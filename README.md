# React.js Project, Queer Entertainment

### Overview
Queer Entertainment is a film directory that displays a list of LGBTQ films.

### Requirements
json-server and npm

### How to install / use
Steps:
### 1: Once you have this cloned to your device, you will want to ensure that you are in the react_lgbtq_project folder and run open npm install. This will install any needed npm modules to the folder.
### 2: After you have run npm install, you will want to open a duplicate tab in your terminal or commanader and ensure both tabs are in the react_lgbtq_project folder. From there, you will want to run `npm run server` in one tab and `npm start` in the other tab. The run server will begin to run the db.json for the data to populate and npm start will start the react application in a browser. 
### 3. Feel free to explore the site! This is a single page application that uses several react components, such as navigation, movie directory and form submittion.
        * At the top, you will see a navigation bar. This will allow you to navigate through the three main components. At the moment, you are on the home page, which displays the navbar and a card describing what the site is about. 
        * In the LGBTQ Movies tab, you will find the directory of movies. This displays a list of movies in cards and there is a search function at the top. The search function allows you to search for a movie based on the title. 
        * In the Add New Movie tab, this will take you to a form to add a new LGBTQ movie. You will want to enter the movie title, the release year, genre and image url. Once that is input, you can click add movie and that will redirect you back to the directory where your movie will now be displayed. 

###Notes
###All images used for the movie poster were taken from imdb.com





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
